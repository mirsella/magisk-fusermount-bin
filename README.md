# magisk-fusermount-bin
i used the rclone magisk module, but with android 11 or due to my custom rom the fusermount binary was not available and rclone broke. this module install a fusermount to /system/bin.

i got the binary from here, for arm64-v8 : https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/fusermount-on-android-rclone-mount.3866652/
